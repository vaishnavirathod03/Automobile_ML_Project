EDA, or exploratory data analysis, is an essential step in any machine learning project.
It involves analyzing and visualizing the data to gain insights into its structure, patterns, and relationships. 
EDA helps to identify data quality issues, understand the distribution and range of the features, and inform feature engineering and selection.
There are several techniques and tools for performing EDA in machine learning, including:

Data visualization: Visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots can help to identify outliers, distributions, 
and relationships between features.

Summary statistics: Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation can provide insight into the central tendency, variability, 
and distribution of the data.

Correlation analysis: Correlation analysis can help to identify relationships between features and their impact on the target variable.

Missing value analysis: Missing value analysis helps to identify missing data and decide how to deal with it, 
such as imputing missing values or removing samples with missing values.

Feature selection: Feature selection involves identifying the most important features for the machine learning model 
and eliminating irrelevant or redundant features.

Dimensionality reduction: Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) can help to reduce the number
of features and simplify the data without losing significant information.

Overall, EDA is a critical step in the machine learning process that helps to identify important insights and inform modeling decisions. 
By understanding the data and its structure, machine learning models can be developed more effectively and accurately.
